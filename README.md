The PrintNC Mini is a version of the PrintNC(https://wiki.printnc.info/en/home), made for smaller footprint.

Like the PrintNC, the mini is a high-performance, DIY CNC router, with steel construction and 3d printed parts.
The Mini does not have the same support and information available and is currently in the stage of getting a reliable, usable, thoroughly tested CAD model.
This repo is the home of said CAD model, with the latest fixes and changes approved by the community.

Is there something youâ€™re looking for that is not here yet? Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/RxzPna6) and ask there. Answers are fast and the community is quickly growing!
